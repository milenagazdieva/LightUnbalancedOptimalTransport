# Light Unbalanced Optimal Transport

This is the official `Python` implementation of the [NeurIPS 2024](https://nips.cc) paper **Light Unbalanced Optimal Transport** (paper [page](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/poster/94382) on NeurIPS) by [Milena Gazdieva](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h52_Zx8AAAAJ&hl=en), [Arip Asadulaev](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wcdrgdYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Evgeny Burnaev](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=pCRdcOwAAAAJ&hl=ru) and [Alexander Korotin](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=1rIIvjAAAAAJ&hl=en).

The repository contains reproducible `PyTorch` source code for fast, simple, and effective solver which allows solving the continuous **unbalanced entropic optimal transport** (UEOT) problem in minutes on CPU. The algorithm can be used to approximate the **UEOT plans**.

## Application to Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation Task

A popular testbed which is usually considered in OT/EOT papers is the unpaired image-to-image translation task. However, the usage of the balanced OT/EOT solvers in these tasks lead to failures in certain cases, e.g., when the attributes of objects from source and target distributions are not balanced or the distributions are contaminated with outliers.

This problem could be alleviated by using our **unbalanced** EOT solver. Our method offers a parameter $\tau\in \mathbb{R}_+$ which controls the level of unbalancedness of the learned plans. For small $\tau$, our solver truly learns the UEOT plans, while for large $\tau$, its results are close to those of balanced solvers. In contrast to other existing UEOT solvers, our ULightOT solver is **fast**, **light** and **theoretically justified**. 

<!-- It can be used to get approximations of UEOT plans with minimal transport cost (quadratic).  -->

<!-- We consider subsets of FFHQ dataset (*Adult, Young, Man, Woman*) and test our solver with different parameters $\tau$ in all variants of translations between them. The main challenge of the described translations is the *imbalance of classes* in the images from source and target subsets which can be succesfully mitigated by using our solver.  -->

**An example**: unpaired *Adult*$\rightarrow$*Young* translation by our ULightOT solver ($\tau=100$) applied in the latent space of ALAE for 1024x1024 FFHQ images. Our ULightOT solver converges in several minutes on 4 cpu cores and is robust to the imbalance of *gender* classes in source and target distributions.

## Repository structure

The implementation is CPU-based and tested with `torch==2.0.0`.

The experiments are issued in the form of pretty self-explanatory jupyter notebooks (`notebooks/`). For convenience, the majority of the evaluation output is preserved. Auxilary source code is moved to `.py` modules (`src/`). The code for launching ALAE model is located in `ALAE/` folder. Checkpoints for classifies used to evaluate the performance of our solver in the unpaired image translation problem are moved to `checkpoints/` folder.
- ```notebooks/ULightOT_gaussians.ipynb``` - experiment with *Gaussian mixtures* in 2D (demonstrates the ability of our solver to deal with *class imbalance* issue);
- ```notebooks/ULightOT_gaussians_outliers.ipynb``` - experiment with *Gaussian mixtures* with added outliers in 2D (demonstrates the ability of our solver to simultaneously hadle the *class imbalance* and *outliers* issues);
- ```notebooks/ULightOT_alae.ipynb``` - experiment with unpaired image-to-image translation using the latent space of ALAE autoencoder.
